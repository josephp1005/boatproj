      <img class = "imgs" src = "sisyphus_boulder.jpeg" > 
      <p>
        In the bleak pits of Tartarus, Sisyphus’ eternal torment has been just short of impossible. 
        His penance for cheating death seemed cruel but simple: pushing a boulder to the top of a hill. 
        However, every time he completes this Herculean task, he is greeted with an even more cruel fate: the boulder rolls back down the hill. 
        Amidst the blood, sweat, and tears of the past 10,000 years, Sisyphus’ only rest occurs on his hour walk back to the bottom. Until today. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The gods of Carney 104 have taken pity on Sisyphus’ poor soul and wish to help carry the boulder. 
        Unfortunately, Hades, ruler of the underworld, does not take lightly to people directly interfering in his realm. 
        The solution? Help Sisyphus in secret. 
        Today, we have built a machine worthy of the gods that only requires the touch of a marble to set Sisyphus free from his eternal tragedy. 
        The stakes have never been higher. To fail is to subject Sisyphus to a fate more difficult than death. An existence of futility.

        <h3>Step 1: Marble Down PVC Pipe</h3> 
        <img class = "imgs_working" src = "step pics/1.png" > 
        <p>
          The machine begins with Casey - Sisyphus’ savior - dropping a marble down a PVC pipe. The marble initially has potential energy, which is quickly converted to
          kinetic energy as it gains speed. The marble then rolls into a cup, beginning the next step. 
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2: Pendulum Swings</h3> 
        <img class = "imgs_working" src = "step pics/2.png" > 
        <p>
          Upon receiving the marble, a cup begins its motion in the form of a pendulum. The cup makes contact with a Play-Doh-covered stick, which functions as a stopper for a 
          spring-loaded car. The cup first has potential energy and gains kinetic energy as it approaches the stopper. 
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3: Stopper Knocked Over</h3>
        <img class = "imgs_working" src = "step pics/3.png" > 
        <p>
          After its collision with the cup, torque causes the stopper to have rotational motion as the spring-loaded car is released. The stopper gains rotational kinetic energy and loses potential energy
          as falls toward the table. The transfer of energy from the pendulum to the stopper to cause the rotation is further documented and analyzed below. 
        </p> 
        <h3>Step 4: Spring-loaded Car Released</h3>
        <img class = "imgs_working" src = "step pics/4.png" > 
        <p>
          The spring-loaded car, which was full of potential energy, accelerates quickly as soon as the stopper is out of its way. The potential energy is stored in a spring, which
          decompresses to propel the car forward. This step is further documnented and anaylzed below.  
        </p>
        <h3>Step 5: Dominoes Knocked Over</h3> 
        <img class = "imgs_working" src = "step pics/5.png" > 
        <p>
          The spring-loaded car sets off a series of dominoes. Each domino applies a torque to the subsequent domino. Energy is fully transferred between dominoes because, following a
          collision, a domino lays flat on the table (height is 0), which means it has no potential energy or rotational kinetic energy. 
        </p>
        <h3>Step 6: Mouse Trap Activated</h3>
        <img class = "imgs_working" src = "step pics/6.png" >
        <p>
          The final domino falls into a vertical mouse trap. The trap is activated and causes the water balloon to pop. There was plenty of potential energy in the trap initially, which 
          is converted to kinetic energy. The high speed of the trap's hammer is ideal for popping the water balloon. This step is further documnented and anaylzed below. 
        </p>
        <h3>Step 7: Cup Fills Up</h3>
        <img class = "imgs_working" src = "step pics/7.png" >
        <p>
          After the water balloon is popped, water begins flowing into a cup through a funnel. Before the pulley begins moving, the cup needs to gain enough mass to overcome the tension force.
          The increase in mass corresponds to an increase in the potential energy of the cup.
        </p> 
        <h3>Step 8: Pulley Saves Sisyphus</h3>
        <img class = "imgs_working" src = "step pics/8.png" >
        <p>
          Once the cup has filled up, it starts to lose potential energy and gain kinetic energy due to gravity as it falls to the ground. At the same time, the boulder gains 
          translational kinetic energy, rotational kinetic energy, and potential energy while it goes up Sisyphus' enormous hill: the Hot Wheels track. This step as well as the previous
          one are further documented and analyzed below. 
        </p>

    <div class="card">
        <h2 id = "building">BUILDING THE MACHINE - FAILURES AND SUCCESSES</h2>
        <p>
          We completed all of the building and testing at Joseph’s house over the span of two days. 
          On the first day, we focused on developing our initial design and making the key components of the machine. 
          We also aimed to record a single step for the assignment we had for class. 
          The second day involved completing and testing the machine as well as making slight alterations until we had a complete video. 
          Please continue reading for a more detailed description of the various phases and the challenges and successes. 
        </p>

        <h3>Phase #1: Building the Pulley</h3>
        <p>
          For the first assignment, we decided to choose the pulley as the step we would create and record. 
          We knew the pulley would likely be the most intricate, so we wanted to make progress on it as soon as possible. 
          We watched some tutorials on YouTube and concluded that we could use cardboard, a bottle cap, glue, string, and a skewer. 
          The skewer would go through two circular pieces of cardboard, and a bottle cap would be in the middle and glued to both sides. 
          The bottle cap allowed for the pulley to have smoother rotation, though it was still non-ideal since it had notable mass and there was friction. 
          Overall, the friction was minimal, as we later found that the energy lost by the cup attached to the pulley roughly equaled the energy gained by the boulder <strong>(success 1)</strong>. 
          Therefore, the design of our pulley lent well to the principles of the conservation of energy. 
        </p>
        <p>
          One challenge we faced with the pulley was that the string on the bottle cap sometimes got stuck right next to one of the cardboard circles <strong>(challenge 1)</strong>. 
          We often forgot to check before each run, so the pulley would unexpectedly move very slowly. 
          To overcome the obstacle, we taped down stacks of popsicle sticks on both sides of the axel of the pulley. 
          As a result, the pulley was kept sturdy and the string shifted fewer times. 
        </p> 

        <h3>Phase #2: Building the Pendulum</h3>
        <p>
          Our first workday was dedicated to constructing the pulley. 
          For the second workday, we began by working on another contraption: a pendulum. 
          There were a few important constraints for the pendulum. 
          First, the mass swinging from the pendulum had to have enough surface area to contact the stopper so the spring-loaded car could be released. 
          Second, the mass needed to initially be attached to the PVC pipe and have a hole to accept the marble. 
          This constraint meant that the mass could not be too heavy because, otherwise, it would slip when trying to attach it to the PVC pipe. 
          We decided to use a simple cup because it was light and could easily be attached to the PVC pipe with a small amount of Play-Doh <strong>(success 2)</strong>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          While we eventually began to use Play-Doh, we initially used a cup by itself, which presented a few problems. 
          First, the cup was not heavy enough alone to knock over the stopper <strong>(challenge 2)</strong>. 
          Also, it was difficult to attach the cup to the PVC pipe without using a strong tape that would prevent motion <strong>(challenge 3)</strong>. 
          Play-Doh served as the solution to both the problems. 
          We put a small amount of Play-Doh in the cup to increase its mass. 
          Knowing that a Play-Doh surface would have high friction, we then put Play-Doh between the top of the cup and the PVC pipe to consistently catch the marble without the cup slipping too early. 
          The speed of the marble was still sufficient to separate the cup from the PVC pipe and begin the pendulum motion. 
        </p>

        <h3>Phase #3: Creating the Car Stopper </h3>
        <p>
          Along with the cup, the stopper for the spring-loaded car also had important mass constraints. 
          It needed to be light enough to be knocked over while also having a coefficient of friction high enough to prevent movement of the car. 
          At first, we tried to use a small circular plastic container. 
          While it stopped the motion of the car, its structure made it difficult for the cup attached to the pendulum to knock it over <strong>(challenge 4)</strong>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We knew that Play-Doh has a high coefficient of friction, so we thought that it could be used for this problem as well. 
          We inserted a popsicle stick into a ball of Play-Doh, which was both light and able to prevent the car’s motion. 
          This approach was effective, and we kept it for the final product <strong>(success 3)</strong>.

        <h4>Video and Description of Step</h4>
        <p>
          A marble rolls down a PVC pipe and lands in a cup, which then swings downward in the motion of a pendulum to hit a Play-Doh-covered popsicle stick. This collision causes the spring-powered car to be released. 
          The cup also has a piece of Play-Doh inside to facilitate the motion. Help for Sisyphus is on the way!

        <h4>Derivations</h4>
        <p>
          LoggerPro provides the components of velocity, so we can find the overall magnitude by using the Pythagorean theorem, as shown below. A new column in LoggerPro was created to show the total velocity so we could confirm the math we did.
        </p>
        <img class = "imgs_working" src = "pendulum/p1v2.png" > 
        <p>
          We wanted to first find the cup's maximum velocity before it hits the Play-Doh-covered stick. To do so, we needed to calculate the change from potential energy to kinetic energy. 
          We started by finding the total potential energy before the cup began its motion. 
        </p>
        <img class = "imgs_working" src = "pendulum/p2v2.png" > 
        <p>
          We can use the maximum potential energy to find the cup's maximum velocity at its lowest point. Since the cup is not completely at the ground when it reaches
          max velocity, it also has some potential energy at the lowest point. 
        </p>
        <img class = "imgs_working" src = "pendulum/p3v2.png" >
        <p>
          When the cup makes contact with the Play-Doh-covered stick, rotational motion is caused. First, we considered the Play-Doh-covered stick as a rod to calculate its moment of inertia.
        </p>
        <img class = "imgs_working" src = "pendulum/p4v2.png" >
        <p>
          Next, we can use the final velocity and height of the cup from LoggerPro to calculate its total energy at the end. 
        </p>
        <img class = "imgs_working" src = "pendulum/p5v2.png" >
        <p>
          The collision between the cup and the Play-Doh-covered stick is largely elastic. Therefore, the total energy of the cup should equal the total energy of the
          Play-Doh-covered stick - both rotational kinetic energy and potential energy. This relationship can be used to find the angular and linear velocities of the Play-Doh-covered stick. 
        </p>
        <img class = "imgs_working" src = "pendulum/p6v2.png" >
        <h4>Sample Calculations</h4>
        <p>
          We can verify that the total energy of the pendulum is comparable to the total energy of the falling Play-Doh-covered stick by doing a sample calculaton. 
          First, we found the total energy of the pendulum at a particular time. 
        </p>
        <img class = "imgs_working" src = "pendulum/p7v2.png" >
        <p>
          We then calculated the total energy of the falling Play-Doh-covered stick at a certain time. Both rotational kinetic energy and potential energy are included in the total 
          energy. 
        </p>
        <img class = "imgs_working" src = "pendulum/p8v2.png" >
        <p>
          Using the derivation above, we predicted the velocity at this same time (1.375 seconds). 
        </p>
        <img class = "imgs_working" src = "pendulum/p9v2.png" >
        <h4>LoggerPro Data</h4>
        <p>Data from Pendulum:</p>
        <img class = "modal-target" src = "pendulum/logger_pro.png" >
        <p style="text-align:center">*Note: A cosine fit is used for the y position of the cup since its motion should be comparable to simple harmonic motion.</p>
        <p>Data from Play-Doh-covered Stick:</p>
        <input type="checkbox" id="zoomCheck4">
        <img class = "modal-target" src = "plato_stick/logger_pro.png" >
        <h4>Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          First, our calculation for the maximum velocity was 1.082 meters per second, but, based on LoggerPro, the maximum velocity was only around
          0.783 meters per second. Since the theoretical velocity was higher, it is likely that friction in the pendulum caused a loss of energy. Moreover, the
          height of the cup at maximum kinetic energy was retrieved from LoggerPro, which means there could be slight error due to the position of the origin in 
          the video analysis. This height was necessary since the cup still had some potential energy when it reached maximum kinetic energy. 
        </p>

          Next, our derivation for the moment of inertia of the Play-Doh-covered stick is slightly inaccurate since we considered it to be a rod. While the stick is clearly bottom heavy due
          to the Play-Doh, we do not know the exact distribution of mass. Therefore, interpreting the stick as a rod was our best option. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Although we considered the collision to be perfectly ellastic in our derivation for the velocity of the Play-Doh-covered stick, energy was likely lost due to heat or sound. 
          Thus, we expected our predicted values for velocity to be slightly higher than they should be. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Before doing a sample calculation for the velocity, we wanted to confirm that the overall energy was largely similar for the motion of the pendulum and the stick. We picked two
          random points in the respective motions and found that the total energy was extremely similar - there was only a 0.0003 J difference. This shows that the collision, while not perfectly
          elastic, follows the basic principles of the conservation of energy. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we used our derivation to calculate the velocity of the stick at a particular time. As expected, our predicted velocity, 0.832 meters per second, was slightly
          larger, specifically 0.528 meters per second greater than the actual velocity from LoggerPro. The diference reflects loss of energy, which can be attributed to heat and friction
          when the cup and stick collided. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, this energy transfer reflects the fundamental concepts of conservation of energy, simple harmonic motion, and rotational motion. Of course, our calculations had 
          some innacuracy due to factors not fully in our control. Most importantly, though, Sisyphus was one step closer to freedom!

        The final push! In this final energy transfer, Sisyphus’ boulder finally makes it up the mountain. After the pop of the water balloon, the cup begins to fill with water. As the force of gravity overcomes the tension force in the string, it begins to fall. The string is attached via a non-ideal pulley to the boulder, which is allowed to roll up the hot wheel track mountain.
        As the cup falls, it gains mass but also loses height. This should create a quadratic curve for the PE of the cup. In addition, it also gains kinetic energy as gravity accelerates it down. However, this problem becomes involved when we take the boulder into account. Some of the energy of the cup falling is transferred via tension to the boulder, which gains PE, KE translational, and KE rotational. This is modeled below via the logger pro data collected above:
      </p>
      <img class = "modal-target" src = "pulley/image2.jpg" >
      <p>
        As can be seen in the graph, the Cup’s total energy decreases from initial to final while the energy of the boulder increases from initial to final. This is because the act of pulling up the boulder decreases the final velocity of the cup, thus decreasing its total final energy. 
        In return, the boulder will increase in energy as the work from tension is acting upon it. Here are the derivations:
      </p>
      <img class = "data" src = "pulley/image3.jpg" >
      <p>
        As you can see from these derivations, the energy lost from the cup closely resembles the energy gained from the boulder, with a difference of 0.002J. 
        This suggests that very little energy is lost across the entire system, as the play doh boulder allows it to roll up the ramp without slipping while also not providing any non-conservational work.
